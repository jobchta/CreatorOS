# LogicLoom

**The Creator Business Operating System.**

LogicLoom is an all-in-one platform designed to replace the fragmented stack of tools (spreadsheets, Notion, Metricool, Linktree) that creators currently use to run their businesses. It focuses on **Business Management**, not content generation.
